          Netwrk responds to copyright complaints submitted under the Digital
          Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). Section 512 of the DMCA outlines
          the statutory requirements necessary for formally reporting
          copyright infringement, as well as providing instructions on how an
          affected party can appeal a removal by submitting a compliant
          counter-notice.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Netwrk will respond to reports of alleged copyright infringement,
          such as allegations concerning the unauthorized use of a copyrighted
          image as a profile or header photo, allegations concerning the
          unauthorized use of a copyrighted video or image uploaded to our
          website or links that include allegedly infringing materials. Note
          that not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted materials are
          infringements.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>Am I a copyright holder? How do I know?</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If you are unsure whether you hold rights to a particular work,
          please consult an attorney or another adviser as Netwrk cannot
          provide legal advice. There are plenty of resources to learn more
          about copyright law including http://copyright.gov,
          https://lumendatabase.org/, and
          http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP, to name a
          few.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, please consider
          whether or not the use could be considered fair use.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with
          a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user
          in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the
          user. You can reply to the user’s message or send the user a Direct
          Message and ask for them to remove your copyrighted content without
          having to contact Netwrk.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Prior to submitting a formal complaint with Netwrk, please be aware
          that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages,
          including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if
          you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is
          infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting
          is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before
          filing a notification with us.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Note: In general, the photographer and NOT the subject of a
          photograph is the actual rights holder of the resulting photograph.
          If you’re unsure whether or not you own the copyrights to a work, or
          if you’re infringing upon someone else’s work, please consult an
          attorney or another advisor.

          What information do you need to process a copyright complaint?
        </h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          To submit a notice of claimed copyright infringement, you will need
          to provide us with the following information:
        </p> <ul data-v-3264b404><li data-v-3264b404>
            A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will
            suffice) of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on
            their behalf;
          </li> <li data-v-3264b404>
            Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
            infringed (e.g., a link to your original work or clear description
            of the materials allegedly being infringed upon); Identification
            of the infringing material and information
          </li> <li data-v-3264b404>
            Identification of the infringing material and information
            reasonably sufficient to permit Netwrk to locate the material on
            our website or services;
          </li> <li data-v-3264b404>
            Your contact information, including your address, telephone
            number, and an email address;
          </li> <li data-v-3264b404>
            A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the
            material in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright
            owner, its agent, or the law; and
          </li> <li data-v-3264b404>
            A statement that the information in the complaint is accurate,
            and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on
            behalf of the copyright owner.
          </li></ul> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If you are reporting the content of a post, please give us a direct
          link to the post. Or please specify if the alleged infringement is
          in the header, avatar, etc. A LINK TO A PROFILE PAGE IS INSUFFICIENT
          FOR Netwrk TO IDENTIFY INFRINGING MATERIALS.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>How do I file a copyright complaint?</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          You can report alleged copyright infringement by filling out a
          Copyright Complaint
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process.
          Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and
          completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, we
          will take action on your request - which includes forwarding a full
          copy of your notice (including your name, address, phone and email
          address) to the user(s) who posted the allegedly infringing material
          in question.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If you are concerned about your contact information being forwarded,
          you may wish to use an agent to report for you.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Please be aware that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for
          any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or
          our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or
          activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you
          are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an
          attorney before filing a copyright complaint.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>How are claims processed?</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          We process copyright complaints in the order in which they are
          received. Once you’ve submitted your complaint, we will email you a
          confirmation. If you do not receive a confirmation that means we did
          not receive your complaint and you should re-submit your complaint.
          However, please note, submitting duplicate copyright complaints will
          result in a delay in processing.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If we decide to remove or disable access to the material, we will
          notify the affected user(s) and provide them with a full copy of the
          reporter’s complaint (including the provided contact information)
          along with instructions on how to file a counter-notice.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>What information gets forwarded to the reported user(s)?</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If we remove or disable access to the materials reported in a
          copyright complaint, the reported user(s) will receive a copy of the
          complaint, including the reporter’s full name, email, street
          address, and any other information included in the complaint.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If you are uncomfortable sharing your contact information with the
          reported user(s), you may wish to consider appointing an agent to
          submit your DMCA notice on your behalf. Your agent will be required
          to submit the DMCA notice with valid contact information, and
          identify you as the content owner that they are representing.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>What happens next?</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Netwrk’s response to copyright complaints may include the removal or
          restriction of access to allegedly infringing material. If we remove
          or restrict access to user content in response to a copyright
          complaint, Netwrk will make a good faith effort to contact the
          affected account holder with information concerning the removal or
          restriction of access, including a full copy of the complaint, along
          with instructions for filing a counter-notice.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If you’ve not yet received a copy of the copyright complaint
          regarding the content removed from your account, please respond to
          the support ticket we sent you

          My content was removed from Netwrk - Why did I receive a copyright
          complaint?
        </h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If you receive a copyright complaint, it means that access to the
          content described in the complaint has been restricted. Please take
          the time to read through our correspondence to you, which includes
          information on the complaint we received as well as instructions on
          how to file a counter-notice. Please ensure that you are monitoring
          the email address associated with your Netwrk account.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Tip: Removing the material reported in a copyright complaint will
          not resolve that complain
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>What if I want to contest the takedown?</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If you believe that the materials reported in the copyright
          complaints were misidentified or removed in error, you may send us a
          counter-notification(s). A counter-notice is a request for Netwrk to
          reinstate the removed material, and it has legal consequences.
          Alternatively, you may be able to seek a retraction of the copyright
          complaint from the reporter.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>How do I seek a retraction?</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          The DMCA complaint you received includes the contact information of
          the reporter. You may want to reach out and ask them to retract
          their notice. The reporter can send retractions to
          copyright@Netwrk.com , and should include: (1) identification of the
          material that was disabled, and (2) a statement that the reporter
          would like to retract their DMCA notice. This is the fastest and
          most efficient means of resolving an unresolved copyright complaint.
          A retraction is at the sole discretion of the original reporter.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>When should I file a counter-notice?</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          A counter-notice is a request for Netwrk to reinstate the removed
          material, and is the start of a legal process that has legal
          consequences. For example, submitting a counter notice indicates
          that you consent to the jurisdiction of a U.S. Federal court and
          that you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to
          the reporter.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          With these considerations in mind, you may file a counter-notice if
          you believe that this material was misidentified, or you have a good
          faith belief that the material should not have been removed. If
          you’re unsure whether or not you should file a counter-notice, you
          may want to consult with an attorney.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Tip: Re-posting material removed in response to a copyright
          complaint may result in permanent account suspension. If you believe
          the content was removed in error, please file a counter-notice
          rather than re-posting the material.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>What information do you need to process a counter-notice</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          To submit a counter-notice, you will need to provide us with the
          following information:
        </p> <ul data-v-3264b404><li data-v-3264b404>
            A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will
            suffice);
          </li> <li data-v-3264b404>
            Identification of the material that has been removed or to which
            access has been disabled and the location at which the material
            appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (the
            description from the copyright notice will suffice);
          </li> <li data-v-3264b404>
            A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith
            belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of
            mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or
            disabled; and
          </li> <li data-v-3264b404>
            Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you
            consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the
            judicial district in which the address is located, or if your
            address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district
            in which Netwrk may be found, and that you will accept service of
            process from the person who provided notification under subsection
            (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.
          </li></ul> <p data-v-3264b404>
          To submit a counter-notice, please respond to our original email
          notification of the removal and include the required information in
          the body of your reply as we discard all attachments for security
          reasons.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>What happens after I submit a counter-notice?</h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will promptly forward a
          copy to the person who filed the original notice. This means that
          the contact information that is submitted in your counter-notice
          will be shared to the person who filed the original notice.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If the copyright owner disagrees that the content was removed in
          error or misidentification, they may pursue legal action against
          you. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the
          original reporter believes that the takedown was correct or is
          seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the
          material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the
          material that was removed.
        </p> <p data-v-3264b404>
          We cannot offer any legal advice. Should you have questions, please
          consult an attorney.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>
          Filing a copyright complaint or counter-notice is serious business!
        </h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          Please think twice before submitting a claim or counter-notice,
          especially if you are unsure whether you are the actual rights
          holder or authorized to act on a rights holder’s behalf. There are
          legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith
          submissions. Please be sure that you are the actual rights holder,
          or that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed
          in error, and that you understand the repercussions of submitting a
          false claim.
        </p> <h3 data-v-3264b404>
          What happens if my account receives multiple copyright complaints?
        </h3> <p data-v-3264b404>
          If multiple copyright complaints are received Netwrk may lock
          accounts or take other actions to warn repeat violators. These
          warnings may vary across Netwrk’s services. Under appropriate
          circumstances we may suspend user accounts. However, we may take
